# refurbed homework

Hi there,
Let me tell you why I chose to work with Next.js + React instead of
webpack and vanilla JavaScript.

Opting for Next.js with React over vanilla JavaScript and Webpack is a 
strategic choice for efficiency and performance. Next.js offers automatic 
features like server-side rendering and code splitting, making your apps 
faster and SEO-friendly. React's component model simplifies development, 
making code reusable and easier to manage. This combination ensures your 
projects are not only built faster but are also more scalable and 
maintainable in the long run.

For the sake completion, I also added header and navbar using the colors
refurbed site.

To start:

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

The production-ready project can be seen here:
